# Number Reader AI
This is my first real project ive worked on and this took me about 4 days to complete and learn torch
Torch is the AI library I used in this AI
This AI reads a 28x28 pixel screen of black and white, It reads numbers 1-9 from the MNIST database
When starting it gives you an option to Run, Train, Evaluate, or Quit (you are able to change how much the ai is trained in the code)
